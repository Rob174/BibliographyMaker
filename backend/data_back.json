A neighborhood operator takes a current solution and returns a set of similar solutions, denoted as neighbors. In best improvement local search, the best of the neighboring solutions replaces the current solution in each iteration. On the other hand, in first improvement local search, the neighborhood is only explored until any improving solution is found, which then replaces the current solution. In this work we propose a new strategy for local search that attempts to avoid low-quality local optima by selecting in each iteration the improving neighbor that has the fewest possible attributes in common with local optima. To this end, it uses inequalities previously used as optimality cuts in the context of integer linear programming. The novel method, referred to as delayed improvement local search, is implemented and evaluated using the travelling salesman problem with the 2-opt neighborhood and the max-cut problem with the 1-flip neighborhood as test cases. Computational results show that the new strategy, while slower, obtains better local optima compared to the traditional local search strategies. The comparison is favourable to the new strategy in experiments with fixed computation time or with a fixed target.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007/s10732-021-09479-9","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,29]],"date-time":"2021-06-29T03:46:27Z","timestamp":1624938387000},"page":"923-950","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Delayed improvement local search"],"prefix":"10.1007","volume":"27","author":[{"given":"Heber F.","family":"Amaral","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7561-6825","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sebastián","family":"Urrutia","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lars M.","family":"Hvattum","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,29]]},"reference":[{"issue":"4","key":"9479_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"355","DOI":"10.1007/s11590-006-0031-4","volume":"1","author":"RM Aiex","year":"2007","unstructured":"Aiex, R.M., Resende, M.G., Ribeiro, C.C.: TTT plots: a perl program to create time-to-target plots.

Nowadays, due to the new policies and regulations related to greenhouse gas emission in the transport sector, logistic companies are paying higher penalties for each emission gram of <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant=\"normal\">2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>/km. With electric vehicle market penetration, many companies are evaluating the integration of electric vehicles in their fleet, as they do not have local greenhouse gas emissions, produce minimal noise, and are independent of the fluctuating oil price. The well-researched vehicle routing problem (VRP) is extended to the electric vehicle routing problem (E-VRP), which takes into account specific characteristics of electric vehicles. In this paper, a literature review on recent developments regarding the E-VRP is presented. The challenges that emerged with the integration of electric vehicles in the delivery processes are described, together with electric vehicle characteristics and recent energy consumption models. Several variants of the E-VRP and related problems are observed. To cope with the new routing challenges in E-VRP, efficient VRP heuristics and metaheuristics had to be adapted. An overview of the state-of-the-art procedures for solving the E-VRP and related problems is presented.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155/2019/5075671","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,9]],"date-time":"2019-05-09T19:31:14Z","timestamp":1557430274000},"page":"1-48","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":90,"title":["A

This paper tackles a generalization of the VRPSD known as the multicompartment VRPSD (MC-VRPSD), a problem in which each customer demands several products that, because of incompatibility constraints, must be loaded in independent vehicle compartments. To solve the problem, we propose three simple and effective constructive heuristics based on a stochastic programming with recourse formulation. One of the heuristics is an extension to the multicompartment scenario of a savings-based algorithm for the VRPSD; the other two are different versions of a novel look-ahead heuristic that follows a route-first, cluster-second approach. In addition, to enhance the performance of the heuristics these are coupled with a post-optimization procedure based on the classical 2-Opt heuristic. The three algorithms were tested on instances of up to 200 customers from the MC-VRPSD and VRPSD literature.

Specifically, several new interesting problems, which are hard to solve, have arisen in the context of viral marketing, disease analysis, and influence analysis, among others. Companies and researchers try to find the elements that maximize profit, stop pandemics, etc. This family of problems is collected under the term Social Network Influence Maximization problem (SNIMP), whose goal is to find the most influential users (commonly known as seeds) in a social network, simulating an influence diffusion model. SNIMP is known to be an <jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$\\mathcal {NP}$$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n                <mml:mi>NP</mml:mi>\n              </mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula>-hard problem and, therefore, an exact algorithm is not suitable for solving it optimally in reasonable computing time. The main drawback of this optimization problem lies on the computational effort required to evaluate a solution. Since each node is infected with a certain probability, the objective function value must be calculated through a Monte Carlo simulation, resulting in a computationally complex process. The current proposal tries to overcome this limitation by considering a metaheuristic algorithm based on the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) framework to design a quick solution procedure for the SNIMP. Our method consists of two distinct stages: construction and local search. The former is based on static features of the network, which notably increases its efficiency since it does not require to perform any simulation during construction. The latter involves a local search based on an intelligent neighborhood exploration strategy to find the most influential users based on swap moves, also aiming for an efficient processing. Experiments performed on 7 well-known social network datasets with 5 different seed set sizes confirm that the proposed algorithm is able to provide competitive results in terms of quality and computing time when comparing it with the best algorithms found in the state of the art.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007/s12652-021-03510-4","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,30]],"date-time":"2021-09-30T03:53:13Z","timestamp":1632973993000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["A quick GRASP-based method for influence maximization in social networks"],"prefix":"10.1007","author":[{"given":"Isaac","family":"Lozano-Osorio","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jesús","family":"Sánchez-Oro","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Abraham","family":"Duarte","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5112-5629","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Óscar","family":"Cordón","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,30]]},"reference":[{"key":"3510_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"3417","DOI":"10.1007/s10115-020-01461-4","volume":"62","author":"S Banerjee","year":"2020","unstructured":"Banerjee S, Jenamani M, Pratihar DK (2020) A survey on influence maximization in a social network.

This paper tackles a generalization of the VRPSD known as the multicompartment VRPSD (MC-VRPSD), a problem in which each customer demands several products that, because of incompatibility constraints, must be loaded in independent vehicle compartments. To solve the problem, we propose three simple and effective constructive heuristics based on a stochastic programming with recourse formulation. One of the heuristics is an extension to the multicompartment scenario of a savings-based algorithm for the VRPSD; the other two are different versions of a novel look-ahead heuristic that follows a route-first, cluster-second approach. In addition, to enhance the performance of the heuristics these are coupled with a post-optimization procedure based on the classical 2-Opt heuristic. The three algorithms were tested on instances of up to 200 customers from the MC-VRPSD and VRPSD literature. The proposed heuristics unveiled 26 and 12 new best known solutions for a set of 180 MC-VRPSD problems and a 40-instance testbed for the VRPSD, respectively. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1287/trsc.1100.0353","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,2,19]],"date-time":"2011-02-19T04:12:20Z","timestamp":1298088740000},"page":"346-363","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":35,"title":["Constructive Heuristics for the Multicompartment Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Demands"],"prefix":"10.1287","volume":"45","author":[{"given":"Jorge E.","family":"Mendoza","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Équipe Optimisation des Systèmes de Production et Logistiques, LISA (EA CNRS 4094), Université Catholique de l'Ouest, 49008 Angers, France"}]},{"given":"Bruno","family":"Castanier","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Équipe Systèmes Logistiques et de Production, IRCCyN (UMR CNRS 6597), École des Mines de Nantes, 44307 Nantes Cedex 3, France"}]},{"given":"Christelle","family":"Guéret","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Équipe Systèmes Logistiques et de Production, IRCCyN (UMR CNRS 6597), École des Mines de Nantes, 44307 Nantes Cedex 3, France"}]},{"given":"Andrés L.","family":"Medaglia","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centro para la Optimización y Probabilidad Aplicada (COPA), Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad de los Andes, AA 4976 Bogotá, Colombia"}]},{"given":"Nubia","family":"Velasco","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centro para la Optimización y Probabilidad Aplicada (COPA), Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad de los Andes, AA 4976 Bogotá, Colombia"}]}],"member":"109","reference":[{"key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1287/trsc.1060.0180"},{"key":"B2","unstructured":"Augerat P.

A létrejövő párosításokat elsősorban a piacot szabályozó mechanizmusok adják meg. Az egyoldali párosítási piacok egyik alkalmazási területére, a vesecsere-problémára létezik olyan megközelítés, amely egy súlyozott párosítási problémára vezet vissza. A disszertációban ezt a megközelítést általánosítom az m-dimenziós párosítások által, amelynek egy speciális esetét m-szobatárs problémaként definiáljuk. Ezzel egy Pareto-hatékony megközelítést határozunk meg, amelyben minimalizálási és maximalizálási problémákat is tekintünk. A megfogalmazott megoldási keretre egyenletes klaszterezési megközelítésként hivatkozunk, a disszertáció célja pedig ennek elméleti és gyakorlati megoldhatóságának vizsgálata. A megfogalmazott m-szobatárs problémában a hallgatókat euklideszi térbeli pontok reprezentálják, és azt hogy mennyire lennének egymás számára jó szobatársak, a közöttük adódó távolságok adják meg. A cél azonosan m fős szobák beosztása a szobákon belüli távolságnégyzetek összegének minimalizálása vagy maximalizálása mellett attól függően, hogy homogén vagy heterogén klasztereket kívánunk megadni. A dolgozatban elsőként összefoglalom az azonos elemszámú csoportok kialakításának és általánosan az elemszámkorlátokkal ellátott feladatok szakirodalomban előforduló széleskörű alkalmazási lehetőségeit. Ezt követően bevezetem a probléma nehézségének tárgyalásához elengedhetetlen fogalmakat, majd ezek ismeretében áttekintést adok a szakirodalomban található, az egyenletes klaszterezéshez kapcsolódó problémák bonyolultságelméleti eredményeiről. Az általános dimenziós eredményeket kiterjesztem, és megmutatom, hogy valamennyi általunk tekintett probléma legalább háromfős csoportok esetén NP-nehéz, vagyis jelenlegi ismereteink szerint nem tudjuk általánosan hatékonyan megoldani. Ezután bemutatom az egyoldali párosítások legalapvetőbb, stabil szobatársak megközelítésének fontosabb eredményeit, megadom az m-szobatárs probléma formális definícióját, majd összevetem a szobatárs problémákat elméleti és gyakorlati szempontból. A bonyolultságelméleti eredmények tükrében ezután a gyakorlati megoldhatóság felé fordulok. Ehhez elsősorban áttekintem azokat az egyenletes klaszterezési problémák során alkalmazott algoritmusokat, amelyek valamilyen garanciát adnak az általuk talált megengedett megoldás szuboptimalitására: az approximációs eljárásokat, valamint a kúp optimalizálást. Másodsorban pedig a gyakorlati alkalmazások során leggyakrabban tekintett megoldási módszerre, a heurisztikus eljárásokra térek rá. E során az algoritmusok széles körét tekintem, amelyhez két módon járultam hozzá. Egyrészt különböző heurisztikus eljárásokat fogalmaztam meg a hagyományos klaszterelemzéshez kapcsolódó módszerek által adott, nem feltétlen egyenlő elemszámú csoportok kiegyenlítésére. Másrészt pedig az egyszerű párok cseréjével operáló LCW algoritmus esetén megvizsgáltam a nagyobb méretű cserék lehetőségét, és megfogalmaztam három heurisztikus eljárást, amelyek kettes és hármas cserék segítségével keresik az optimumot. A bemutatott valamennyi heurisztikus eljárást valós adathalmazokat és szimulációkat is magába foglaló, széleskörű elemzés során vetettem össze. A felállított elemzési keret erőssége, hogy lehetővé teszi, hogy egyszerre tekintsük mind a minimum-, mind a maximumfeladatot, és átfogóan elemezzük az m-szobatárs probléma gyakorlati megoldhatóságát. Ezekkel pedig túlmutatok a korábbi tanulmányokon, amelyek jellemzően az algoritmusok egy szűkebb körét és csupán az egyik célfüggvény ellenében tesztelik. A vizsgálathoz megadtam az összes szobabeosztás előállításának egy olyan konstrukcióját, amely lehetővé tette, hogy alacsony hallgatói számok mellett, az össztávolságokat hisztogramon ábrázolva szemügyre vegyük a megengedett megoldások terét. Az algoritmus felírásához a szobabeosztások formális definícióját is megadtam. További lényeges részlet az optimalitási pontszám definiálása, amelyet az elemzési keret minimum- és maximumproblémát is tartalmazó sajátosságát felhasználva tudtam bevezetni. Ennek segítségével ábrázoltam az algoritmusok egymáshoz képest vett teljesítményét, és a tesztelt heurisztikák alkalmazásával elérhető maximum- és minimumértékek különbségéhez képest is ki tudtam értékelni az algoritmusokat. A heurisztikus eljárások elemzése során a következő eredményeket fogalmazom meg. Az irodalomban hagyományosan tekintett, való életből származó ‘Iris’ és ‘Seeds’adathalmazokon a legtöbb minimalizáló eljárás hasonlóan jól teljesít, így nem lehet ez alapján különbséget tenni közöttük. Az egyszerű konstruktív módszerek, valamint a klaszterközéppontok meghatározását és az elemek klaszterközéppontokhoz való hozzárendelését alternáló eljárások nem teljesítenek jól a feladat megoldása során. A kis hallgatói létszámmal rendelkező esetek a szobabeosztások költségeinek ferde eloszlását mutatják, amely a minimalizálási és maximalizálási problémák lehetséges általános aszimmetriájára utal. A nagy hallgatói létszám esetén elvégzett elemzés megmutatja, hogy az optimalizálási problémák minimalizálási és maximalizálási feladat, valamint kis- és nagyméretű csoportok esetén is más-más karakterisztikákkal rendelkeznek, amely a heurisztikus eljárások teljesítményeiben tükröződik. A minimalizálási feladat megoldásához szignifikánsan nagyobb futásidő szükséges. A hármas cseréket is megvalósító LCW alapú heurisztika bizonyos esetekben önmagában is releváns. Ugyanebben a módszerben kezdeti értékként alkalmazva valamely másik eljárás által adott megengedett megoldást, előbbi jelentősen javíthat azok célfüggvényértékén. A lokális keresést alkalmazó eljárások köréből a legegyszerűbbnek számító és egyben leggyorsabb LCW eljárás teljesítménye pedig nem sokkal marad el a szofisztikáltabb módszerek eredményeitől, így a gyakorlati alkalmazás esetén a konkrét céltól függően ezzel is elfogadható megoldáshoz juthatunk.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.14267/phd.2022071","type":"dissertation","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,28]],"date-time":"2022-11-28T12:34:50Z","timestamp":1669638890000},"approved":{"date-parts":[[2022,11]]},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Egyoldali párosítási piacok egyenletes klaszterezési megközelítésben"],"prefix":"10.14267","author":[{"sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gábor","family":"Kondor","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"5805","container-title":[],"original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http://phd.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/1210/1/Kondor_Gabor_dhu.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,28]],"date-time":"2022-11-28T12:34:52Z","timestamp":1669638892000},"score":1,"degree":["PhD"],"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://phd.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/1210/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[null]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.14267/phd.2022071","relation":{},"url":"http://phd.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/1210/"},"relevant_text":[],"tags":["exclLanguage","notCited"],"analysis":""},{"id":"a33eea2a916a048d0ade5094a559641c2","bibtex":{"doi":"","title":["HIBRIDIZAÇÃO DE HEURÍSTICAS, COM PROGRAMAÇÃO INTEIRA E MINERAÇÃO DE DADOS, PARA A SOLUÇÃO DE DUAS VARIANTES DO PROBLEMA "],"author":[{"given":"Francisco","family":"Glaubos_Nunes_Clímaco"}],"URL":"https://www.cos.ufrj.br/uploadfile/publicacao/2964.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"url":"https://www.cos.ufrj.br/uploadfile/publicacao/2964.pdf"},"relevant_text":[],"tags":["exclLanguage","dontUse"],"analysis":""},{"id":"a0e9f2b6f86204dd2b3de85e01aa14c2f","bibtex":{"doi":"","title":["反復局所探索法における探索の多様化に関する調査"],"author":[{"given":"岡野","family":"傑士"},{"given":"金原","family":"一歩"},{"given":"三宅","family":"孝史"},{"given":"片山","family":"謙吾"}],"URL":"https://ous.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_action_common_download&item_id=2284&item_no=1&attribute_id=18&file_no=1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,9]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,9]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,9]]},"url":"https://ous.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_action_common_download&item_id=2284&item_no=1&attribute_id=18&file_no=1"},"relevant_text":[],"tags":["exclLanguage","dontUse","notSure"],"analysis":""},{"id":"a358fdc8a746d4052ae0b9c1bcabbe75d","bibtex":{"doi":"","title":["Evde bakım hizmetlerinin değişken komşuluk arama algoritması ile çizelgelenmesi"],"author":[{"given":"Tuba","family":"Özbay"}],"URL":"http://acikerisim.pau.edu.tr/xmlui/handle/11499/2090","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,1]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,1]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,1]]},"url":"http://acikerisim.pau.edu.tr/xmlui/handle/11499/2090"},"relevant_text":[],"tags":["exclLanguage","dontUse"],"analysis":""},{"id":"ae988debfc5714304b9f35cdd93bf92d9","bibtex":{"doi":"","title":["Problem usmjeravanja elektriˇcnih vozila"],"author":[{"given":"Tomislav","family":"Erdelic"}],"URL":"https://www.fpz.unizg.hr/zits/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/KDI_pregledan_rad_Tomislav_Erdelic.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,1]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,1]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,1]]},"url":"https://www.fpz.unizg.hr/zits/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/KDI_pregledan_rad_Tomislav_Erdelic.pdf"},"relevant_text":["Redoslijed izvodenja operatora utje ¯ ce na kvalitetu rješenja i vrijeme izvršavanja.

Such approaches find good quality solutions but require additional procedures such as beam search and sampling to improve solutions and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, few studies have focused on improvement heuristics, where a given solution is improved until reaching a near-optimal one. In this work, we propose to learn a local search heuristic based on 2-opt operators via deep reinforcement learning. We propose a policy gradient algorithm to learn a stochastic policy that selects 2-opt operations given a current solution. Moreover, we introduce a policy neural network that leverages a pointing attention mechanism, which can be easily extended to more general<jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-opt moves. Our results show that the learned policies can improve even over random initial solutions and approach near-optimal solutions faster than previous state-of-the-art deep learning methods for the TSP. We also show we can adapt the proposed method to two extensions of the TSP: the multiple TSP and the Vehicle Routing Problem, achieving results on par with classical heuristics and learned methods.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007/s42979-021-00779-2","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,23]],"date-time":"2021-07-23T15:02:35Z","timestamp":1627052555000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":10,"title":["Learning 2-Opt Heuristics for Routing Problems via Deep Reinforcement Learning"],"prefix":"10.1007","volume":"2","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0509-8724","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Paulo","family":"da Costa","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jason","family":"Rhuggenaath","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yingqian","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alp","family":"Akcay","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Uzay","family":"Kaymak","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,23]]},"reference":[{"issue":"4","key":"779_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"289","DOI":"10.1016/0893-6080(88)90002-0","volume":"1","author":"B Angeniol","year":"1988","unstructured":"Angeniol B, Vaubois GDLC, Le Texier JY.

The SA is based on an analogy with thermodynamic to optimize solutions to combinatorial optimization problems.SA performs perturbations in the current solution in an iterative way, seeking better neighbor solutions. An important feature of SA is the fact that it allows worse solutions as a form of diversification of the search. In doing this, SA tends to escape from local optimum, seeking a global optimum in later iterations","The Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is an extension of Job Shop Scheduling (JSP), which is closer to reality, allowing an operation of a given job to be processed by alternative machines","Therefore, it is proposed an algorithm based on the Clustering Search (CS) metaheuristic to generate solutions, and thus produce a set of non-dominated solutions in order to obtain the Pareto frontier, providing to decision maker a set of quality solutions","The Clustering Search metaheuristic (CS) is a generic definition of Evolutionary Clustering Search (ECS) [28].

This is done by randomly selecting points from the candidate set  until at least one of the ingredient availabilities is exceeded. The final feasible design produced by this procedure is the starting design for the VNS procedure. The construction of the initial design is described in Algorithm 1, where  represents the starting design.","As soon as such an improved design has been found, the neighborhood N0 of that newly found design is constructed and explored to attempt to find an even better design in terms of the D- or I-optimality criterion. At some point in time, this procedure will result in a design for which the neighborhood N0 does not contain any better alternative. That design then is a local optimum with respect to neighborhood N0. It might, however, not be a locally optimal design with respect to neighborhood N1. Therefore, the next step is to explore the neighborhood N1 of that design until a better one is found. As soon as a better design has been obtained from N1, the algorithm switches back to the smallest neighborhood N0 and attempts to find a better design in that neighborhood. If no better design can be found in neighborhood N1, then the algorithm switches to neighborhood N2","Algorithm 2 Pseudocode of the VNS algorithm for finding an optimal design.","In Section 4, we propose a VNS algorithm for the D- and I-optimal design of mixture experiments involving ingredient availability constraints.","prcentroid_algo.png","A mixture experiment is an experiment in which the experimental factors are ingredients of a mixture, and the response depends only on the relative proportions of the ingredients.

We call this the Multi-operator MetaHeuristics (MMH) problem and we introduce it in Section 3. We assume that these two restarting techniques are complementary but with the same goal of finding better local optimum. The stochastic perturbator operators exploit the structure of the search space, and thus they can be considered the diversification tech- nique of LS. The variable neighbourhood search is the intensification technique for the MMH problem because it explores the search space by changing the size of the neigh- bourhood.","To improve upon multi-restart LS’s performance, stochastic local search aims to es- cape from local optimal sets by stochastic perturbation operators that preserve partia","In this section, we propose a class of metaheuristic algorithms that use two (possible more) schemes that restart the local search.

For the same purposes, modern manufacturing cells, in compliance with industry 4.0 concepts, use material handling systems in order to allow more control on the transport tasks. In this paper, a job-shop scheduling problem in vehicle based manufacturing facility that is mainly related to job assignment to resources is addressed. The considered job-shop production cell has two types of resources: processing resources that accomplish fabrication tasks for specific products, and transporting resources that assure parts’ transport to the processing area. A Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm is used to schedule product manufacturing and handling tasks in the aim to minimize the maximum completion time of a job set and an improved lower bound with new calculation method is presented. Experimental tests are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007/s11590-020-01674-0","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]],"date-time":"2020-11-26T17:02:52Z","timestamp":1606410172000},"page":"255-280","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Bi-local search based variable neighborhood search for job-shop scheduling problem with transport constraints"],"prefix":"10.1007","volume":"16","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8078-6696","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Moussa","family":"Abderrahim","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Abdelghani","family":"Bekrar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Damien","family":"Trentesaux","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nassima","family":"Aissani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Karim","family":"Bouamrane","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"reference":[{"key":"1674_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"459","DOI":"10.1108/01439911011063281","volume":"37","author":"H Martinez-Barbera","year":"2010","unstructured":"Martinez-Barbera, H., Herrero-Perez, D.: Development of a flexible AGV for flexible manufacturing systems.

Each individual represents a solution to the problem as a vector of n elements xi where ∑ni=1xi=m, as in Eq. 1. All initial individuals already undergo a weak local search in line 4. Given that we can get to a neighbor of a solution by exchanging one element from M to N∖M, the weak local search is a first-improvement local search [10] that tests all neighbors in random order and moves to any neighbor that improves the current solution until no neighbor is able to improve the current solution.","If the best solution known has been improved by the end of the iteration, the new current solution undergoes the weak local search with a best-improvement approach instead of the ordinary first-improvement algorithm.","We propose a memetic self-adaptive evolution strategy (MSES) presented in Fig. 1 that includes local searches [15, 20], self-adaptation of the σi mutation parameter [4, 6, 15] and a low probability crossover operator.","The maximum diversity problem consists in finding a subset of elements which have maximum diversity between each other. It is a very important problem due to its general aspect, that implies many practical applications such as facility location, genetics, and product design. ","Evolution strategies (ES) are a class of evolutionary algorithms primarily dependent on mutation [4]. The notation ES(μ,λ) stands for an ES with μ parents and λ \nchildren, being each of those individuals a candidate solution to the problem.\n\nThe algorithm is based on generations that repeat until a halting criteria is reached. In a generation, μ\nparents are mutated to produce λ children. Afterwards, the best μ new individuals become the current parents. A common adaptation to ES is to include a step size or mutation strength variable σi associated with each individual i [4]. This variable is often adjusted through self-adaptation, that is, by also applying secondary mutation operators on the associated σi values and expecting the best configurations to survive over time. This adjustment of the algorithm composes the self-adaptive ES.","We propose a memetic self-adaptive evolution strategy (MSES) presented in Fig. 1 that includes local searches [15, 20], self-adaptation of the σi mutation parameter [4, 6, 15] and a low probability crossover operator."],"tags":["diff-algorithm","mention-concl-FIvsBI","useDirect-FIvsBI","different-problem","CL","pbMaxDiversity","algoGeneticAlgo","algoMemetic"],"analysis":""},{"id":"a9967978d278440d298f233d71cfd540a","bibtex":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,2]],"date-time":"2022-11-02T12:10:49Z","timestamp":1667391049002},"reference-count":31,"publisher":"IEEE","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":[],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"DOI":"10.1109/clei.2018.00026","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,6]],"date-time":"2019-08-06T00:40:36Z","timestamp":1565052036000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["A Hybrid Iterated Local Search Metaheuristic for the Flexible job Shop Scheduling Problem"],"prefix":"10.1109","author":[{"given":"Dayan","family":"de C.

This is done for all pairs of retail stores on the route. Furthermore, within the Intra-route Relocate operator, one store is removed from the tour and reinserted at another position. Within every local search operator, we look for the best neighbor solution (see [18]).","For solving the underlying routing problem, we chose VNS. The basic idea of VNS is the interchanging of two phases: during the Local Search phase, the local optimum is obtained, whereas the solution is perturbed during the Shaking phase. We adapt this method to suit our problem and propose Algorithm 1.","In the Shaking phase, we perturb the solution by using one of the following operators: Inter-route Two-opt, Inter-route Swap or Inter-route Relocate. The selection of the operator is done randomly and operators are performed only between two routes. The Inter-route Two-opt operator deletes one edge from both routes and reconnects the routes so that the direction is preserved (also known as ⁎operator). The idea of Inter-route Two-opt is depicted in Fig. 4. The procedure is repeated until we reach the hth neighborhood; no edge can be addressed more than once during the same iteration.","Therefore, we let the number of vehicles vary during the optimization process. As for the initial number of vehicles, r, we assume that all retail stores should be visited more or less close to the middle of the working day (operation time window). ","After obtaining the initial number of routes, r, we also select r seed customers, being the retail stores located furthest away from the depot, and assign them to the routes. Additional locations are selected by applying the Regret Insertion operator. The benefit of the Regret heuristic on vehicle routing problems has been outlined by Trick [40] and recently by Pisinger and Ropke [33","In the Local Search phase, we randomly select one of the operators: Intra-route Two-Opt, Intra-route Swap or Intra-route Relocate","A VNS approach to multi-location inventory redistribution with vehicle routing","This paper analyzes a two-echelon inventory problem with uncertain demand, where perishable products are distributed from a central warehouse to retail stores."," The model is solved with variable neighborhood search, which is extended with a dynamic programming sub-routine to handle inventory allocation.","algorithm1"],"tags":["near-tsp","useDirect-FIvsBI","mention-concl-FIvsBI","different-problem","same-heuristic","diff-algorithm","algoVNS","algoLinearProgramming","pbMultiLocInventoryRedistrWithVehicleRouting"],"analysis":"This paper chooses the best improvement refering to the First vs Best improvement: an empirical study paper.

Initially, a GRASP metaheuristic is proposed to solve an assembly-line balancing problem (SALBP-2). The proposed method presented competitive results in relation to the literature, also focusing on a simplicity of operation to be applied in real cases. Subsequently, the same method was used to solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP). The GRASP developed for the JSP also presented good results, with low average relative deviation in relation to the best solutions known in the literature. Next, we approached an extension of the JSP, the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP). The JSP is limited to the sequencing of operations on fixed machines, whereas in the FJSP the assignment of an operation is not preset and can thus be processed on a set of alternative machine","In order to solve the FJSP, we proposed four meta-heuristics: GRASP, Simulated Annealing (SA), Iterated Local Search (ILS) and Clustering Search (CS).

Exceptions are two groups GKD instances with  elements, and MDG-c instances with  elements. This is where the first improvement strategy significantly outperforms the best improvement strategy (with respect to the best found solutions).","On the entire set of instances, the VNS_MinDiff_FI heuristic performs slightly better (see row ‘Total Average’ in Table 1, i.e., compare 1767.12 and 1782.24 for total average values for VNS_MinDiff_FI and VNS_MinDiff_BI, respectively). The advantage of VNS_MinDiff_FI basically comes from the results obtained on the largest MDG-c instances. Indeed, VNS_MinDiff_BI may spend more time exploring a whole neighborhood of a current solution before making a move. ","The similar pattern regarding comparison of the first and the best search strategies in solving travelling salesman problem has been observed in [11: First vs Best Improvement …. ].","(iii) Average solution values offered by VNS_MinDiff_BI are better than those found by VNS_MinDiff_FI on all instances from data sets GKD 500, MDG-a 500, MDG-b 500 and MDG-b 2000 (see the number of wins in Table 2). Moreover, only on data set MDG-c, VNS_MinDiff_FI succeeded to provide larger number of better average solution values than VNS_MinDiff_BI. In addition, on 138 out of total 190 instances, VNS_MinDiff_BI provides better average solution values, while VNS_MinDiff_FI do so on just 30 instances. However, VNS_MinDiff_BI provides better best found solution value than VNS_MinDiff_FI on only 46 instances, while VNS_MinDiff_FI do so on 45 instances.","n this paper, we propose a basic variable neighborhood search for solving Minimum differential dispersion problem using only the swap neighborhood structure in both descent (intensification) and shaking (diversification) step","Comparative results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

In Table 1, for both VNS variants, we report the average values of the best, average, and the worst solution values found on a certain data set obtained in forty runs (columns ‘best’, ‘avg.’ and ‘worst’, respectively).","In Table 2, for each data set, we report the number of instances (# wins) where: the best solution offered by one VNS variant is better than the best solution found by another variant (column ‘best’); the average solution offered by one VNS variant is better than the average solution found by another variant (column ‘avg.’); and the worst solution offered by one VNS variant is better than the worst solution found by another variant (column ‘worst’).","Table1"],"tags":["mention-concl-FIvsBI","different-problem","diff-algorithm","redoExp","diffRes","CL","pbMinDifferentialDispPb","algoVNS","cmpAvg","cmpBest","cmpStdDev","cmpWins"],"analysis":"In this paper a VNS algorithm is designed to solve the Minimum differential dispersion problem.

A Wilcoxon rank sum test with a significance level of 95% shows that the best improvement step function indeed does not perform significantly better.

Starting from a random solution, FI computes better results that BI. Conversely, starting local search from a given greedy or nearest-neighbor solution, BI is better and faster than FI on average.","In 55% of the cases, BI was better than FI. On average, BI terminates in a local optimum 3.11% and FI 3.18% above the best known solution. This average improvement of BI over FI of 0.07% is small. Hence, the results of Hansen and Mladenović [40] of the STSP cannot be projected to the CVRP.","The benchmark instances are generated by varying the number of customers, the customer distribution within the Euclidian plane, the demand distribution of customers, and the vehicle capacity. Altogether there are 600 instances grouped into 10 series of 60 instances each. Any series include instances of 15 different sizes, i.e., number  of customers, ranging from  to 2500. For each size there are four different demand distributions. Table 1 summarizes the series.","The paper introduces sequential search as a generic technique for the efficient exploration of local-search neighborhoods. One of its key concepts is the systematic decomposition of moves, which allows pruning within local search based on associated partial gains. The application of theoretical concepts to several well-known neighborhoods of the vehicle-routing problem (VRP) is demonstrated","Here, we will analyze the running time and solutions quality for both strategies applied to savings solutions of the CVRP. We use the 40 different instances with customers (10 series, ) and compute 18 (different) starting solutions using a parametrized savings algorithm. Starting with the same initial solutions, BI and FI are separately applied in 2-opt, 2-opt*, swap, relocation, or-opt, and string-exchange local-search procedures until a local optimum to all neighborhoods is found.","First, in contrast to the results of the previous sections, the value of has no significant impact on the solution quality or running time comparing BI and FI. In about 85% of all 720 cases, FI was faster than BI. However, the average running time of BI () exceeds the average running time of FI () by only 9%. The reason for this is that each iteration of the FI local search takes less time, but more iterations are needed to reach a local optimum.","algo 6"],"tags":["near-tsp","same-heuristic","CL","NL","redoExp","mention-concl-FIvsBI","diff-algorithm","diffRes","pbCVRP","algoSequentialSearch","cmpWins"],"analysis":"One section of this paper is dedicated to comparison between the First and Best Improvement strategy for the CVPR problem as a study case for the sequential search algorithm.

These effects often occur when it is desired that a facility be located as far as possible from an inhabited center (obnoxious effect) or when a facility cannot be located far enough, although its closeness can have immediate disturbing or dangerous effects (semiobnoxious effect). Location problems with obnoxious effect arise when locating nuclear power plants, chemical plants, and dump sites, while examples of location problems with semiobnoxious effect include locating airports, recycle plants, and so on.","For that purpose, on the largest instance pmed40-p225.A, each local search procedure is run 1000 times, each time starting from a different random solution.

In the best-improvement strategy the entire neighborhood N (s) is scanned for the best improvement. The selected improvement s0 is guaranteed not to be dominated by another other solution in N (s). In the first-improvement strategy, the first solution s0 in N (s) that improves s is returned immediately. Hansen and Mladenovi´c [8] find that for single-objective LS, first-improvement usually leads to better empirical results. Liefooghe et al. [9] confirm this result for PLS algorithms, as do Drugan and Thierens [5] for SPLS.","Following previous work [5, 8], we can distinguish two strategies for PI, a best-improvement and a first-improvement implementation. Unlike SPLS, where improvements are applied once per iteration, we apply the improvements recursively until no improvement can be found.","We compare against two non-PLS-employing MOEAs: NSGA-II and SPEA2,  and against the PLS-employing method we emprically found best for MO-CoGs: Drugan and Thierens’ first-improvement genetic SPLS [5].","To generate MO-CoGs, we follow the random graph generation procedure proposed by Roijers et al. [16]."," This prevents premature deletion of solutions. Unlike other PLS methods, the queued approach “protects” dominated solutions until they are mutated to a locally optimal state. As in previous PLS work, we embed QPLS in a genetic scheme. We empirically compare Genetic QPLS against the state-of-the-art PLS method Genetic SPLS [5], and against the popular non-PLS MOEAs NSGA-II [3] and SPEA2 [21], using multi-objective coordination graphs ","In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for Pareto local search that we call queued Pareto local search (QPLS), which stores promising solutions in a queue. When such a solution is popped off the queue, QPLS performs strict Pareto improvements by looking for a stricly better solution (in all objectives) in the neighborhood of the solution. Only when such improvements are no longer possible, is it compared to a Pareto archive. This prevents premature deletion of solutions.","Fig. 2.

A constructive heuristic is a building of a solution from the data by examining the characteristics of the problem to be solved. This construction is hard to figure out in different applications. On the other hand, the improvement heuristic initially starts with a random solution and then endeavours to decrease the cost of the OF by allowing a series of local changes. The quality of the final solution depends on the starting solution and the rules used to generate neighbouring solutions. Thus, a good approach is considered when a constructive heuristic is applied to the result obtained from an improvement method (Mladenovi and Hansen 1997, Hansen and Mladenovi 2006).","4.3.3. Summary of the proposed heuristics We have three factors at two levels each: constructive versus improvement method, FI versus BI, and with SA using the modified cooling schedule versus without SA","figure6","Our first solution procedure constructs the associated team and product DSMs using a random sequence of the process and then varies the process DSM using an improvement method (column 6 in Table 7). The constructive heuristic for the teams in the people DSM, given a specific process sequence, is as follows and the constructive heuristic for clusters in the product DSM is shown in Appendix 2.","Organisations involved in product development (PD) constantly introduce new products using development teams within the organisation. These teams carry out PD activities using the established development processes in order to produce new products. Traditionally, these three domains (product, process, and people) are treated separately and individual optimisation is attempted for each domain (i.e. without regard for the other two domains). The result is a group of three individual-domain optimal solutions instead of a single-multi-domain optimal solution. The main objective of this paper is to formulate and find the multi-domain optimal solution for a PD project.","To measure the accuracy (i.e. effectiveness) of the proposed approaches, the relative variation (RV) ratio is devised. The formula used to calculate the RV ratio is: ","The eight approaches proposed were simulated for the same 60 examples (used in Section 4.2 and shown in Appendix 1), and each instance is run 10 times. This results in a total of 600 different runs. The best answer achieved was recorded and compared with the solution of optimisation in isolation.","Figure 6 shows the intersection of the trend lines for the number of iterations (left side vertical axis) and percent RV from best-known solution (right side vertical axis).

In this study, it was significantly slower, giving almost always the same final results as the first-improvement local search. PSH local search rules suggested for this approach are basically the moves in two or more directions at the same time. Since there are too many possibilities for such moves, heuristics is applied to choose the promising ones. Here, the heuristics heavily depends on comparing the values of different objectives for an observed solution. The objectives have different units and orders of magnitude. As already mentioned, the fuzzy approach is appropriately chosen for such situation.","Multi-objective design and operation optimization of energy supply systems with respect to costs, energy efficiency and environmental indicators is a very important, yet difficult and challenging task","The SS procedure starts by creating diverse initial solutions and improving them. After that, the reference set is constructed. Then, iteratively, subsets are created and new solutions are generated combining subsets members. These new solutions are improved and, if suitable, added to the reference set, which is updated.","The subsets of the reference set are the combinations of 2–4 reference set members. Here, only two-element subsets are used. Combining solutions — subsets members — is, as a generic rule, conducted by generating linear combinations of starting vectors, both inside and outside their convex regions (binary variables require another approach). In this case, since the variables are discrete, rounding is necessary. Additionally, as a PSH rule, each pair of solutions is combined to yield two new solutions by exchanging cooling parts of the vectors, i.e. the values of the variables . This procedure could be regarded as a deterministic analogy to the crossover operator of GA."],"tags":["mention-concl-FIvsBI","diff-algorithm","CL","different-problem","redoExp","sameRes","pbEnergySupplyDesignSystem","algoScatterSearch","cmpNotShown"],"analysis":"This paper use an improvement based algorithm to improve a solution as a step of a more global algorithm.

Until recently, best improvement algorithms were commonly used for the neighbourhood exploration strategies in Pareto local search algorithms. The first non-dominating neighbour (Liefooghe et al. 2011) stops after the first non-dominating solution found. The first dominating neighbour (Aguirre and Tanaka 2005; Liefooghe et al. 2011; Dubois-Lacoste et al. 2011b) stops after the first dominating solution.","We show here though that first improvement neighbourhood exploration strategies can be more efficient. A similar observation has recently been made in (Liefooghe et al. 2011). Pareto neighbourhood exploration strategies—or improvement strategies are the equivalent of single-objective improvement strategies (Hansen and Mladenović 2006) for multi-objective spaces","The best performance with SPLS is obtained using the first Pareto improvement strategy, which stops the neighbourhood exploration when a dominating solution is found, and using stochastic perturbation operators which exploit the particularities of the search space","We apply SPLS on a set of large, correlated bi-objective quadratic assignment problems (bQAPs)","The overall conclusion is that the SPLS algorithm with the highest performance is fGPLS using the first improvement Pareto neighbourhood exploration IF and both perturbation methods, mutation and path-guided mutation. The bQAP, where the difference between fGPLS and the other SPLSs is maximal, has the largest number of facilities and the largest correlation, bQAP(100, 0.75).","In this paper, we discuss and analyse three different Pareto neighbourhood exploration strategies: best, first, and neutral improvement. Furthermore, we introduce a deactivation mechanism that restarts PLS from an archive of solutions rather than from a single solution in order to avoid the exploration of already explored regions. To escape from a local optimal solution set we apply stochastic perturbation strategies, leading to stochastic Pareto local search algorithms (SPLS)","We apply SPLS on a set of large, correlated bi-objective quadratic assignment problems (bQAPs) and observe that SPLS significantly outperforms multi-start PLS.","Table 2(A) shows the average and the standard deviation of the hypervolume unary indicators of the six SPLSs on twelve testing bQAPs. Table 2(B) compares the six SPLS algorithms: (i) the mean hypervolume for the three values of ρ and four numbers of facilities, n, (ii) the number of wins of fGPLS, bGPLS and fMPLS over the six SPLSs, and (iii) the rank of each SPLS algorithms based on the number of wins","For the same bQAP instance, we measure if the difference between two measurements of Table 2(A) is statistical significant using the Wilcoxon non-parametric two samples test, where p<0.05. Figure 4 presents five EAFs at 2 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100% for two algorithms, fMPLS and fGPLS, on two bQAPs, bQAP(75, 0.5) and bQAP(75, 0.75). Overall, fGPLS is the best tested SPLS and nMPLS is the worst algorithm. ","Attainment surfaces at 2 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % (lines from bottom left to top right) of the normalized outputs. The two tested SPLSs are: (i) fMPLS on the left and (ii) fGPLS on the right. The two tested bQAPs are: (i) bQAP(75, 0.5) top and (ii) bQAP(75, 0.75) bottom. These EAFs are compared with the best known Pareto set for the two bQAPs: (i) A ∗(75, 0.5) top and (ii) A ∗(75, 0.75) bottom. The objective values found at 2 % EAFs correspond to the best Pareto set found over 50 runs and those found at 50 % EAFs are the median outcome"],"tags":["redoExp","CL","mention-concl-FIvsBI","diff-algorithm","different-problem","sameRes","pbQAP","pbBQAP","algoSPLS","cmpAvg","cmpStdDev","cmpWilcoxon","cmpWins"],"analysis":"This publication redo the test of both First and Best improvement in a pareto local search setting.

For example, conclusions derived from the “first versus best improvement” empirical study (Hansen and Mladenović, 2006) are confirmed in solving more than dozen combinatorial optimization problems, but still, one cannot claim that properties of the first and the best improvement strategies within 2-opt local search in solving TSP will hold in solving any other problem by any other local search method.","We explore the most commonly used TSP neighborhood structures, such as 2-opt and insertionneighborhoods.","Move or not decision (i.e., if an improvement has been detected in some neighborhood, there areseveral options to continue the search after updating the incumbent solution): (i) Basic VND (B-VND)—return to the first neighborhood on the list","For B-VND, P-VND, and C-VND, the first improvement search strategy is a better option if aninitial solution is chosen at random. On the other hand, if an initial solution is constructed in agreedy manner, the best improvement search strategy turns out to be a better choice (comparethe averages for B-VND, P-VND, and C-VND over six possible orders). Note that a similar conclusion was drawn in (Hansen and Mladenovi ́c, 2006)","In a single local search algorithm, several neighborhood structures are usually explored. The simplest way is to define a single neighborhood as the union of all predefined neighborhood structures; the other possibility is to make an order (or sequence) of the predefined neighborhoods, and to use them in the first improvement or the best improvement fashion, following that order. In this work, first we classify possible variants of sequential use of neighborhoods and then, empirically analyze them in solving the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP)","We explore the most commonly used TSP neighborhood structures, such as 2-opt and insertion neighborhoods. In our empirical study, we tested 76 different such heuristics on 15,200 random test instances. Several interesting observations are derived. In addition, the two best of 76 heuristics (used as local searches within a variable neighborhood search) are tested on 23 test instances taken from the TSP library (TSPLIB). It appears that the union of neighborhoods does not perform well.","In this paper, we focus on sequential VND variants","Our empirical study considers VND variants that differ in the following aspects:      1. Order of neighborhoods that may play an important role in the quality of the final solution.     2.      First or best improvement search strategy. Once the neighborhood structures are ordered and placed on the list, we still have a few possibilities on how to perform a search within them. A question common to any local search heuristic is whether to use:         (i) the first improvement strategy—as soon as an improving solution is detected, it is set to be the new incumbent solution, or         (ii) the best improvement strategy—the best among all improving solutions, if any, is set to be the new incumbent solution.      3.      Move or not decision (i.e., if an improvement has been detected in some neighborhood, there are several options to continue the search after updating the incumbent solution):         (i) Basic VND (B-VND)—return to the first neighborhood on the list.         (ii) Pipe VND (P-VND)—continue the search within the same neighborhood.         (iii) Cyclic VND (C-VND)—resume the search on the next neighborhood from the list.         (iv) Union VND (U-VND) (or multiple neighborhood search, where the single neighborhood is obtained as the union of all predefined neighborhoods)—continue the search in the same large neighborhood. U-VND has recently been proposed in Lu et al. (2011), Wu et al. (2012) and used within Tabu search.      4.      Initial solution can be obtained at random or by applying some constructive heuristic. ",", we perform exhaustive testing on a data set of TSP instances, generated randomly from a uniform distribution on the [0,100] × [0,100] square varying number of nodes, that is, n, from 20 to 1000 (for more details, see Hansen and Mladenović, 2006). More precisely, the data set is obtained by generating 1000 instances for each urn:x-wiley:09696016:media:itor12282:itor12282-math-0020, and by generating 100 instances for each urn:x-wiley:09696016:media:itor12282:itor12282-math-0021. In each test instance, the distance between any two nodes is calculated as the Euclidian distance. These instances are classified as: the small instances with up to 100 nodes; the medium instances whose number of nodes ranges from 150 to 350; and the large instances that have more than 350 nodes","More precisely, over each set of instances (small, medium, large, or entire set) we report the following values: the average of solution values attained, the percentage deviation of this value from the average of best-known solution values for considered data set (calculated as the average of the best solution values returned by the tested heuristics), ","Table 1"],"tags":["near-tsp","same-heuristic","diff-algorithm","CL","redoExp","mention-concl-FIvsBI","sameRes","pbTSP","algoVND","algoSeqVND","cmpAvg","cmpAvgDevFromBest"],"analysis":"The paper explore the configurations of sequential variable neighborhood searches: the initial solution used, the first or best improvement strategy and how to pass from one type of neighborhood to another.

The authors find that for random starting solutions, best improvement provides worse results than first improvement. When using starting solutions constructed by a greedy or nearest neighbor heuristic, however, best improvement is better and faster on average. ","The third possibility is the pruning of neighborhoods, i.e., to heuristically reduce the size of the neighborhoods. A very popular example is granular search","[Pivoting rules] first improvement (FI): Apply the first move that leads to a solution with better objective function value.","[Pivoting rules] best improvement (BI): Apply the best move found","Interestingly, best improvement is not used in any of the non-dominated algorithmic variants. The superior behavior of first and sequential improvement over best improvement may be explained by the design of GLS: because the generator arc lists are sorted from most to least promising arc, we assume that a first improvement search returns moves that are often almost as good as the best moves but are found in much shorter time","The IFG set comprises a total of 600 instances, which are grouped into ten series that differ with regards to the coefficient of variation of the demand distribution. To keep the computational effort in a reasonable range, we restrict ourselves to the first 36 instances of series 1, which contain a central depot and between 250–1000 customers that are uniformly distributed in the plane. For each instance size, there are four different demand distributions, generated as follows: customer demands are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution over [10, 30], and the vehicle capacity is determined by multiplying the average demand by factors of λ = 25, 50, 75, and 100.","The UPPPVS set comprises 100 instances that contain between 100 and 1000 customers. Customers are positioned either randomly, clustered, or random-clustered, and the depot is located either in the center, the bottom left corner, or at a random point"," Each of these variants is run on each of the problem instances described in Section 4.1 starting from 5000 initial solutions that are generated as described in the following           section.","We aim to generate a set of initial solutions that is as diverse as possible to cover a broad range of the search space. To this end, we use five randomized construction heuristics (nearest neighbor, nearest insertion, random insertion, accelerated best insertion, savings) and generate 1000 different and feasible initial solutions with each of them. Nearest neighbor is the only sequential approach, the remaining four are parallel. Details about the construction heuristics are provided in the following paragraphs","In-depth analysis of granular local search for capacitated vehicle routing","In this paper, we systematically study the impact of design decisions in a granular LS (GLS) for the CVRP","The concrete definition of a basic LS requires many different, potentially dependent design choices like the selection of neighborhood operators, the use of speedup techniques (e.g., granular search), or the pivoting rule (e.g., first vs. best improvement)","In the operations research literature, multiple algorithms or variants of one algorithm are often compared with each other using only two metrics, i.e., the average solution quality (objective value/gap to the BKS) and the average runtime. Then, good algorithms according to these two metrics are found on the Pareto frontier, which contains all non-dominated algorithms, i.e., no other algorithm with better average solution quality and at least the same average runtime (or vice versa) exists. This traditional approach has the following shortcomings: (i) statistically insignificant differences can lead to dominance, e.g., variant is dominated by variant , (ii) the performance of outliers might be weighted too strongly, i.e., a few instances with large differences in the performance of the variants are enough to tilt the averages in either direction, and (iii) the approach is not robust in the sense that very fast algorithms with bad solution quality can still lie on the Pareto frontier.","GLS returns a local optimum with objective value in seconds. We compute the relative gap to a target objective value in percent, the latter given by the best objective value found over all variants and initial solutions for the given instance Based on the computed relative gaps and a maximum accepted deviation (target quality) , let denote the set of initial solution indices for which a successful run occurs, i.e., for which we consider the instance as solved.","To compare the performance of the algorithmic variants, we follow the statistical analysis method of Coffin and Saltzman [3]. Instead of measuring the time required to reach optimality on a problem instance, a statistical unit now measures the average time to success as defined above"," A variant  is considered better than an alternative  if the average time  is smaller than  in a consistent manner across the benchmark set. In statistical terms, the null hypothesis is that GLS behaves similarly with either variant, i.e.,  whereas the alternative hypothesis states that an impact can be observed, i.e., . A variant  is dominated if evidence allows us to reject  at a level of significance . We call this approach statistical dominance and use it in the remainder of the paper if not explicitly stated otherwise. Non-dominated variants are tested pairwise until a Pareto set remains. We compute the Pareto set using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with , and we set the target quality to .","To visualize the performance of the algorithmic variants, we use a plot of performance profiles [5]. In such a plot, each curve—in the first quadrant of a Cartesian coordinate system—represents the performance profile of one variant on the given instance set. A point on a curve means that the associated variant can solve the proportion of the instances when given times the time taken by the fastest variant to solve each of the respective instances","Our approach to deal with the underlying tradeoff between solution quality and runtime is to get rid of the quality dimension by defining that a certain variant solves an instance if it reaches, i.e., matches or beats, a certain target quality on this instance. In this fashion, we use the information on how often a variant solves an instance for all starting solutions and the time it takes to perform the search runs to compute an average solution time for an instance that already comprises solution quality."],"tags":["near-tsp","mention-concl-FIvsBI","diff-algorithm","CL","redoExp","sameRes","notSure","pbCVRP","algoLocalSearch","algoVND","cmpPerfProfile","cmpRmvQuality"],"analysis":""}],"tags":[{"id":"a00381dd566744bb8acfc29e892389801","name":"same-heuristic"},{"id":"abe45214a9c6b4d5383f504a3176a4561","name":"different-problem"},{"id":"a8e0c332b123349acad2608d7ab09a2d9","name":"near-tsp"},{"id":"a6290bb383ba14cf2bdb69a97380d138e","name":"diffRes"},{"id":"a8e28554d003c4d40bcee155128dcc94d","name":"sameRes"},{"id":"afe6bc7b31dbb4aafa3b8fc611788e340","name":"deadlink"},{"id":"aeacc522c4b7a483da34b4762f08423ec","name":"CL"},{"id":"a1637f7661f0b49ed9bebe8f549371f57","name":"useDirect-FIvsBI"},{"id":"a3d46f3eec912481c9dac1d587f38f3e1","name":"tsp"},{"id":"a1873933139004b95aa682585f9444702","name":"NL"},{"id":"ac66c609ee9d24ee09833702cfbf4f764","name":"exclLanguage"},{"id":"a5781507b799041f0a6b5ab5c6dfb5c91","name":"notUsedInPaper"},{"id":"abc6409cd752d474eaa00974dd88e28ef","name":"notSure"},{"id":"a3368431d20ca439bae1b6b6399c3cf25","name":"exclBook"},{"id":"a31545c695472499d875ee479d9600c18","name":"mention-concl-FIvsBI"},{"id":"a5c4047c3cc5a4574bd2232f5c7db9ffb","name":"diff-algorithm"},{"id":"a6f6629c441c8453cb82e8e3859d15125","name":"exclAccess"},{"id":"a8e2d4223bbbe434491d1649dc1cfa13c","name":"dontUse"},{"id":"aa868f80aa68943d2aaa034cf48f360e5","name":"redoExp"},{"id":"a4d10fbb2d16d4db1a7645ae356795c69","name":"not-follow-FIvsBI"},{"id":"aa85b927ae7f342cd88918335a8a54b6c","name":"notCited"},{"name":"test","id":"tc2b36c0dc1f04d44b81508e3c2ea14e1"},{"name":"pbCLRP","id":"tf297e2832270493f813760c34da00200"},{"name":"algoGeneticAlgo","id":"t1c409cf2115f4a24a02833ab7b213134"},{"name":"pbMultiObjMatrixDecomp","id":"t91b5d66b42f84d3c9c56c4a5b7f49595"},{"name":"algoPLS","id":"t30800dfadef04eeb97b102be01e0d3d7"},{"name":"pbOCPAD_TSP","id":"t0e356d0f213842559ee357bdb658cdae"},{"name":"pbTSP","id":"t7f33b97c42c24307a9835dc18e72b329"},{"name":"algoVNS","id":"t4fbad2a96ee84d68b7487248e056b374"},{"name":"pbTDTSP","id":"tdde90fc74256487c8b35220293ad5bae"},{"name":"pbTDVRP","id":"t9f974db14a494c75b98aaa3b4923ad3a"},{"name":"algoLocalSearch","id":"tc67b6a0f2ac84e72a620aab755ad9a91"},{"name":"pbVRTWLP","id":"t1a1a7f38756c4e9e87c6e11d258e37b5"},{"name":"pbFJSP","id":"td0dbd4b43602484698ab0596a2d702d4"},{"name":"algoCS","id":"t54f8b3571be94600bc0d624d6980e603"},{"name":"algoSA","id":"td5420b6515dc4c679a62111e846b5bd3"},{"name":"pbRPCentroid","id":"tcce743c0c48842aabebf89b662eb24be"},{"name":"pbMixtureExperiment","id":"t7a0749751b4447a7bb7576c6ab89e9b6"},{"name":"pbKnapsack","id":"t330838764fab41079c08dd07e0d5d4b9"},{"name":"algoIteratedLocalSearch","id":"tf7505d8e053c4f7a9a26113e55b59e1e"},{"name":"pbQAP","id":"t1cd9f8e9c52344b98e8e1c0ab37ec972"},{"name":"pbCardConstraintPortfolio","id":"tc6444ee667d449b89117254d7ac43716"},{"name":"algoLinearProgramming","id":"tba32b61a238b48b985a2627ba2498561"},{"name":"pbJobShop","id":"t85fc4edd401d4700b194ff5b755e7355"},{"name":"pbJobShopWithTransportConstraints","id":"t4f820dcb92c94e31bba2db7f311b99ec"},{"name":"pbDynamicMemAllocationProblem","id":"tc8d8766a2c734c1f8a2250960d88fbed"},{"name":"pbCyclicBandwidthSum","id":"tb9a84b1164614109967ed4e99112cae6"},{"name":"pbBMSSC","id":"t764fa1a50a1e49859c7d2be02f2ba751"},{"name":"pbMaxDiversity","id":"t750cfe7c9560468fa18ca8876ffd05e8"},{"name":"algoMemetic","id":"t359ad0009b8b476f81a15525a3fbdd24"},{"name":"pbFlexibleJobShop","id":"t901371e6208b40599d807c2ab4c95407"},{"name":"pbUBQP","id":"tc74d7b53d723488e82b0d8e75143d7f7"},{"name":"algoTabuHNN","id":"tdf2d67a9a7f4495184705d75174deb0a"},{"name":"pbMultiLocInventoryRedistrWithVehicleRouting","id":"tbd75be1dcf544e54983eefb2d42e998a"},{"name":"pbCVRP","id":"td57c0078c62741f8acb668919c7c9f9b"},{"name":"algoAGS","id":"t2adeab27929b4a8e86f7ad72f709267e"},{"name":"pbFlowShop","id":"t5e6c6a796a864ab4bfa938b912f526e1"},{"name":"pbMSSC","id":"t1f5d0069adf244ac9e5303c87d3a0053"},{"name":"pbTreeBuckingOptimizationProblem","id":"td34e42263beb4ce1a9ca5d354fc72883"},{"name":"pbPipelineTransportationProblem","id":"t8e0127fca2e34cf9a70fcab893f775e7"},{"name":"algoVND","id":"t02ae7ee8b2ea412e85dbc364109785cf"},{"name":"pbMinDifferentialDispPb","id":"t6bb628aee4804109be22c0d94b10548a"},{"name":"cmpAvg","id":"t67620656b590455c8a27cf1410a55494"},{"name":"cmpBest","id":"t829d3fec41d242a9aba7152b0bdb2e82"},{"name":"cmpStdDev","id":"tc6524b6f579f4b20ae3426e4d513ca21"},{"name":"cmpWins","id":"t099ae346140b460fad7a76df597f4085"},{"name":"pbParticleTheraySchedulingProblem","id":"tfdcd9526b7814c6188066f06080a4b67"},{"name":"algoSequentialSearch","id":"tb8099c42847d4007abab701dfd268caa"},{"name":"pbOpMP","id":"t6e061017c46348379fe3633194ad6c02"},{"name":"cmpWorst","id":"t43d9716c9b314082b91641f72e7baadc"},{"name":"algoQPLS","id":"t937e28c4a51d4efabfa81788b67ec672"},{"name":"pbMultiObjCorrdGraph","id":"t13882df53adb4fa998418da966969a80"},{"name":"cmpPbSpecific","id":"tb7ef0988f9414f2683c9bcd6d62491a4"},{"name":"pbDispG
